A Church History of Irelaud is, therefore, a work of no ordi-

nary difficulty, requiring for its execution 8 collection of
books hardly ever found in the same private or even public
library3 manuscripts scattered wherever the Irish ecclesiastical
exiles found a home 3 and free access to the records of government
officeS, of courts of justice, and of corporations, and to the eopious
materiale in the public librarios of England and Ireland.
· To remove some of 111080 0118180108 which obstruet the historian’s path,
81111 following up the resolution intimated in the preface to the Apologia
pro Hibernia, the editor has completed his preparatione for publishing
a series of rare works, illustrating the history of the Irish Catholics,
with several manuscripts already in his possession, 81111 others which he
may be able to procure. These works shall be published at a price
which will make them as accessible as similar works in other coun-
tries, instead of having them, as they are at present, objects of epicure
bibliomania, purchased for their weight in silver or gold. For the in-
formation of those who may not be acquainted with the prices which
those works 011 Irish Catholic History usually bring, it may be sufficient
to state, as an example, that the work which is now given to the
public generally sells for ‚⁴:10 or 215.

O'Sullivan’s Oatholic History comes first on the list= for, though
not first in the order of time, it is second to none in historical value,
It was compiled from 1110 narratives of persons who had been engaged

in those flerce wars which ended iu the general plunder of the Irish

Chureh 81111 people by Elizabeth and J ames Ι. The author was 0110 of
those old Irish nobloe who forfeited their properties and country in the

contest for the liberty of their saith. He tells his story with all the
warmth of a patriot and a zealous Catholie. His tastes, and the character
of those from whom 110 derived his information, led him to pay such at-
tention to merely ecclesiastical details, that he has been transcribed
copiously, and sometimes without acknowledgment, by ecclesiastical
historians, who owe to him alone some of their most interesting pages.
On matters of general history, also, the value of his labours is duly
attested by the very copious extracts which the editors of some of the
most valuable modern publicatione have very judiciously inserted from
him.
