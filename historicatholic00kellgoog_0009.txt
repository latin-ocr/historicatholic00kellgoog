count of his family. Before the English invasion, the O’Sullivans
had occupied rich tracta in the south-east of 'Pipperary3 but being,
like most of the old Irish families of Munster, expelled from their fer-
tile valleys by the invaders, they retreated westward, and, preying on
weaker tribes, took possession of the western parts of Cork and
Kerry. 'Phe wild and mountainous tracts around Bantry Bay, co·
extensive with the barony of Bear and Bantry, were possessed by the
O'Sullevan Bear down to the close of Elizabeth's reign3 audit was in
the island of Baoi Bearra, now Dursey, at the extreme point of the
promontory between Kenmare and Bantry Bays, that our author was
born. His Qdfather, Dermod O'Sullivan, who is warmly eulogized λέ· 5⁶7 49· ,s- .’ ἰ ‚

in the chieftancy little is known except their deaths. Auliffe, brother

of Dermod, and Donald, his son, fell by the sword. From them the
principality passed to Owen O'Sullevan, who held it until the year
1593, when 113 was deposed by the influence of the English, and Dun-
boy, the key of his 'inheritance, was given up to his nephew, Donald.
During the thirty years of Owen's government, he appears not to have ·
taken an active part in the field with Fitzmaurice, or any of the Ga-
tholic insurgents. Once, indeed, he was seized as a hostage by the
Earl of Ormond, in 15 803 but a few years later, his name is found
among those who were present during the parliament of 1585. His
successor, Donald, continued faithful to his patrous nearly ten years,
not shaken in his allegiance by the decisivo victories of the northern
chieftains, nor awed by the triumphant march of Hugh O'Neil to
Munster in 1600. It was only when the Spaniards lauded at
Kinsale that he resolved to fight for the liberty of his church.
He received foreign garrisons into his castles, and, by a formal
document, still extant, transferred his allegiance to the king of
