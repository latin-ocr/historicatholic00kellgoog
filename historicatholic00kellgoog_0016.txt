midable kind ς finally, that he was the very reverse of St. Ῥείη-10191* whose

successor 118 pretended to be. How-ever amusing this may be as one of
the quarrels of authors, it might have been better for our author’s fame

had he suppressed it, his sar-casm and pleasantry generally exhibiting

more anger than wit.

Ussher’ s censure was, of course, adopted by nearly all those his-
torians who did not relish the many disagreeable fact-s which O’Sullivan

has recorded. But an impartial review of this history must- convince any
reader that, however respectable Ussher' s authority undoubtedly is on

the ancient history of Ireland, he was 'grossly unj ust in stigmatizing
our author as an egregious liar. What should the world think of the
critic who would collect the grave errors in Mr. Moore’s history, and
denounce him as an egregious liar? Mr. Moore asserts, in the noon-
day of the nineteenth century, that religion was not even one of the
causes of Irish wars until the year 1600. He also gives a seat in the
Irish Housc of Lords in 1613 to Florence Conry, the exiled Arch-
bishop of Tuam. Similar blunders occur in the works of most historiens.

’ Our author is not free from them3 but there is no evidence that he deli-

berately dealt in that art of coining facts for a purpose, which was deve-

loped to such per-fection by most Protestant historians of Irish affairs ; and
which has been what may be called an official department of Irish
government during the last 300 years. With an unaparing, and what
some have deemed, an imprudent zeal, he has laid bare the faults of
his countrymen3 even his own kindred have not escaped; 118 has not
glossed over their follies and dissensions, nor pandered to their passions
or their pride. His errors are those into which the most truth-loving

may fall, and they happen to ·be fewest on that very period to which
Ussher referred, namely, the affirirs of his00wn time.

Another charge made against our author, is excessivc credulity. Cox,
and other authors of the same stamp, have carefully selected from his

. pages some extraordinary stories; but the-y for-get to add that he gene-

rally gives these storiae as popular reporta, without vouching for their
truth; and that even in the very few instances where 118 (1088 appear to
