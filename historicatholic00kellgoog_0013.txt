letter to Father Oantwell, that 110 had a very exalted estimate of the
historian’s lam-els3 and it is certain that he must have collected the

sketches inserted in this history, but written before it, apparently for

some other work, betray manifest signs of a juvenile hand. Having

⁹ Synnnott, Vendana, and Peter Marcilla, he was destined to serve in the
Spanish army ς but his foi-tunes were for a moment olouded by a duel
in which he was involved at Madrffl, to revenge an insult offered to his
nephevv, Donald, who was killed on the leth of J uly, 1618. Philip
evaded the search of the Spanish police by taking refuge at the French
ambassador's: but he· is found not long after at his post in the Spa-

O'S‘ullivan, Donald’s heir, consoling him for the death of his father,
and giving a detailed account of an action of the Spanish fieet against
