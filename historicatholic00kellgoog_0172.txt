⁸ The women of Drogheda distinguished themselves on other occasions.
Before the year 1610, there was no fixed place for catholic worship in the
town: the few riests who remained celebrated mass and administered the
sacraments in ⁸ erent places and at different hours. In that year the Fran-

rushed in crowds from all parts of the town, and, after a copious volley of
stones aud other missiles, succeeded in rescuing him. Deeming it, however,
more rudent to bow to the storm, for the sake of the eople, he surrendered
himse f, and was conducted the same day to Dublin, ant? bro ht in his friar's
dress before the chancellor, the Protestant Archbishop of Du lin. The cap-
tain of the escort interceded for him, telling the whole history of the capture
and rescue and voluntat-y surrender, and protesting vehemently that he had
never been in so great danger of his life, as from these women of Drogheda.
‘⁴ Hoec risum moverunt simul et iram contra cives incitarunt: frater carceri
mancipatus est, et ibi sex mensibus detentus.” This seizure was part of a ge-
neral plan for taking all the friars and priests, a false brother having promised
that he would insure its success. The Archbishop of Dublin, Eugene Mat-
thews, narrowly escaped on the same day. The house in which he was living
was searched, but he, with another companion, stole out through the windows,
over the roofs of the neighbouring homes, and baffied the government priest-
hunters. The false brother afterwards confessed his crime, “ Gum magno
dolore a nobis per internuntium, veniam petiit et ut speramus in gratia mor-
tuus est.” Mooney, p. 18.
