He had completed the lives of St. Kyran of Saiger‚ St. Abban, St. Ailbe,
St. Declan, and St. Mochudda, but none of these have been published,
except the translation of an Irish life of St. Mochua‚ which he gave to
John Bollandus, nor had Colgan been abl'e to find where the MSS. were
deposited. St. Patrick’s Decade was so called from the division of the
work into ten books, each containing ten chapters. The first eight
books are devoted to the principal events in the life of the saint, agree-
ing generally with the longer lives published by Colgan and the Bol-
landists. 'Phe ninth book purposes to be a history of his favourite
theme, St. Patrick’s purgator53 but it might, with more propriety, be
styled a treatise on the Catholic doctrine of purgatory. The tenth
book contains much miscellaneous matter on Irish history, especially
011 the period subsequent to the Reformation. In the same volume he

we may translate the term, his “ Scourge of the Arch-horned.'’ It was
intended as a reply to Ussher, who, 111 his treatise on the religion of the
ancient Irish, had stigmatized the author of the Oatholic history “ as
being verily the most egregious liar of any in Christendom.'' Το this
foul language the author replies in a strain of mingled argument and
invective, quite in character with the amenities of controversy in his
age. After complaining that so savage an attack was unprovoked,* he
proceeds to discuss Ussher's character, which he despatches in ten
chapters. He undertakes gravely to prove that Ussher was a bear,† by
a detailed enumeration of the qualities 01 both3 that he was grossly
ignorant of arithmetic, for claiming as his own those Irish saints who
fiourished 1,000 years before the Anglican sect came into existence 3ss
that he was an ignorant man, because he wrote a work 011 religion in

the English language3 that he was a horned animal of the most for-
