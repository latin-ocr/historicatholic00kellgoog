taking shelter in a house,” p. 105. Perhaps disinterested readers will think it
more extraordinary that a sect, which was a minority in numbers, walth, and
rank, should have dared to interfere with the public worshi of the Catholics,
than that they should have resisted and endangered the li e even of an arch-
bishop of Dublin. The Dublin catholice, however, aid dearly for this cou-
rage. The En lish council ordered the carmelite c apel to·be razed to the

These acquisitione do not appear either “lawless” or “ extraordinar ς’· they

There is “ no gross exaggeration” iu qualifying the execution of such laws as
“ crimes of enormous oppression and tyranny.''

The life of Ussher is a theme, not to be attempted except in a very delicate
and considerate spirit, with the least possible share of those arrogant feelings,
which grow up unconsciously even in the mildest natures‚ when nursed in as-
cendancy. His biogra hers cannot sasel assail the Irish Catholic or the Presby-
terian settler. While e, and eleven ot er Irish bishops‚ declared it, in form of

rotestation, “ a grievous sin to allow Catholics to exercise their religion free-

,” (A.D. 1626, p. 73,) there was nothing in the internal arrangement of the
Knglican church to induce Oatholics to believe in her. In the diocese of
Mesth‚ the most extensive, the most wealthy, and most English diocese in
Ireland, it a pears from his own repon, (ΑΛ). 1622) that on 243 livings there
were about churches in ruins, 60 ruinous3 15 chancels without churches3
18 churches without chancels3 about half a dozen in good repair, and 50 in
indifferent repair—and this aster a profound ace of nearly 20 years. Of the
72 clergymen of the diocese, 3 were born in reland of English parents, about
15 are marked as “ natives‚” the others, it appears, were imported from England
to convert the ignorant Popish natives, teach them habits of law and order,

the British government of the day.

It is said by some that Ussher‚ in the year 1601, foretold the rebellion
of 1641. He certainly contributed to prepare it ς for, however sincere
he may have been in his reli 'on, and wish for peace, the part
with which he acted had general y very different views. When Bede l
attem ted to “ enlighten the natives,” a general outcry was raised against him
‘⁶ for is endeavouri to make the conquered and enslaved Irish capable of pre-
ferment in church an state, which was the portion of the co ors.”—Mason's
Dedan, p. 275. And those conqueror-s had similar views at a ater period, if we
may believe Edmund Burke. “ From what 1 have observeti, it is pride, arro-

ce, and a spirit of domination, and not a bigoted spirit of religion, that
gd: caused and kept up those oppressive statutes. 1 am sure 1 have known
those who have o pressed Papists in their civil rights exceedingly indulgent to
them in their re gious ceremonies. These persons never saw s man (by
converting) escape out of their power but wit grudging and r et. They
would have become Pa ists, in order to op ress Protestants‚ ' , being Pro-
testants, it was not in eir power to oppress apists.” This was a very com·
mon s irit among those “ conquerors,” whom ΜΓ. Maesulay, injus Hi»-
tory o England‚ calls Spartans. Mamelukes would have been less classic,

but perhapz'nore appropriate.
