Insigne miraculum recensetur.

Ex tyrannidis hujus miraculis, quorum nonnulla partim retuli, partim
[110.] etiam referam, plura tamen praetermittens, unum hic silencio tacitus„
praeterire non possum rei magnitudine coactus. In Lagenia Ministro·

Virginis Matris, ct ipsius Divi imagines indigenis magna semper
veneratione cultas donis a Catholicis collatis, ornamentisque spoliavit,

et altari per comites suos Anglos deturbari fecit. Mox in Catholicos

Novum, atque rarum mirum Daniel O’Murchuus magna vicinorum fre-

· Perhaps this is another version of a story told of Neylan, Bishop of Kil-
dare, 1583, 1603. He was a native of Clare, and a Protestanu in the same
sense as Myler M‘Grath. Kildare audite revenues were good enough during
life, but after death he wished to rest beyond the Shannon with his fore-
fathers‚ in the convent of Ennia, and, he had accordingly erected for him-
self there a splendid tomb of mat-hle. One old friat, who had been allowed to
remain and say mass in the convent, did not like the neighbourhood of the de-
ceased prolate s remains. On the second night aster the mterment, he removed
them, with the aid of a few stout and trust confidants, and consi ed them
to the earth outside the town. The fact, 5 degi-ees, trans ire but was
not, as far as appears from aney, invested with any mirac ons character,
‘⁴ per totam provinciam evulgatum estg omnes tamen riserunt et zelum fratris
laudaverunt, p. 43st Neylan‚ too, was an Irishman—-the Bisho of Ferus, of
whom om· author speaks, was English: Auen, ρθτὴιᾶε, who die in 1599, Bi-
shop of Down, Oonnor and Ferus, and was buried in e town of Fethard. The
O'Moores of Leix are sometimes called O'Morchuui.
