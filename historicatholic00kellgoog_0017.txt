admit them, he may be regarded as an absolute sceptic compared with
those enlightened historiam who, some twenty years later, received
the famous depositione of 1641.ae sworn truths.

The tone of his history, of course, gave offenoe to the Anglican party,
and to their catholic adherents; but how could it be otherwise? He
wrote in Catholic Spain, surrounded by proscribed soldiers of the con·
quered party, a history of that war in which his family had lost their

property, and from which himself had escaped in his boyhood. The
most atmcious cruelties even of that savage war, were perpetrated in
his native island; the defence of the family castle of Dunboy, and the

heroic retreat from Glengarifl', must have suggested trains of reflection
which few men under thirty could discipline into that sobriety which ’
some require in the historian. There was nothing in the state of Ire·
land when he was writing to console him. The Catholies, who had ⁰
fought for Elisabeth, could not save their religion from proscription‚
nor thei: elergy from imprisonment or exile under J ames. They were
not allowed to praetise their religion publi'cly, though they humbly
offered to rebuild some of the ruined churches‚ and to rent them from
the crown, leaving to the Anglicans, the elergy of one tenth of the na·
tion, all the tithes and churchlands. Is it surprising that one of the
rebel Catholics should make some bitter reflectione on those brethren,
who, he believed, had fastened so grievous a yoke on their own necks Ρ

The real defects of his history appear to be its omissione, and a de-
fective chronology. ⁵

He does not profess to give more than slight sketches or general
notices of Irish matters prior to the reign of Henry VIII. It is no
regular history before the middle of Elizabeth's reign, as there are only
a few facts given, and these in general terme, and not unfrequently at
wrong dates.- He passes over slightly the means by which the oath of
the king' s supremaoy was established, the suppression of the monas-
teries, the introduction of the English prayer-book, by king's letter, in
a few ehurches, under Edward VI. In the commencement of Eliza·
beth’s reign, too‚·he does not record the gradual steps by which the
statute· against the Catholic worship were enforced 3 it is only at the :²
close of Desmond’s war that the narrative expande, embracing so full ὶ
an account of the great war under Hugh O’Neil, and of Catholic affairs ³
down to the parliament of 1613, that the loss of this history could not ἱ

be supplied by any work extant. On this latter period his chronology
