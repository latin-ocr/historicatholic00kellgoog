viii PREFAGE.

he set out from Glengariff on the last day of December, 1602, at the
head of 400 men, with a great crowd of women and children, nearly
1,000 in all. Over those rugged mountains, which it is a toil for the
well-appointed conveyances of modern travelling to ascend even in sum-
mer, the little band, among whom were Don Philip’s father and mother,
marched in one day 26 miles to Aghers. Thence, under protection of
the great woods, keeping successively the mountains, which separate
Oork from Kerry and Limerick, they fought their way ιο the fastnesses
of Ahar-low, near the town of lipperary. Entrusting here to some
noble friend, the second son of Donald, a child two years of age, they
effected their retreat north through the barony of Kilmanagh, over the
Sliebh Feilim mountainS, on by the Ormondes, ιο the banks of the
Shannon, above Lough Derg. For the particulare of the battles fought
with the lord Barry at Liscarroll, with the carl of Ormonde in Tip-
perary, and afterwards with the ClanricardS, we refer ιο the narrative
of our author. Having, by the advice of Dermod, killed their horses, and
with the skins constructed currachS, they passed the Shannon at Port-
land, and after several engagementS, and making nearly the circuit of the
county of Roscommon, at last arrived at the castle of Briau O’Bourke,
at Leitrim, on the loth of J anuary, reduced by famine, fatigue, de-
sertion and the sword, ιο the number of thirty-five. “ I am astonished,”
exclaims our author, “ how my father, who was then near seventy years
of age, and my mother, a delicate woman, could have so bravely borne
these fatigues, which broke down so many men in the flower of their
age, and the prime of their strength.''' Before they arrived Bury O'Don-
nell had submitted, and O'N eil was meditating a peace.¹ But there
was no pardon for the O’Sullivans. Don Philip was soon joined in
Spain by his whole surviving family, his father, mother, brother, and two -
sistere, together with the O'Sullivan Bear, Donald himself.

Το the fireside narratives of these exiles, and of many others driven
ιο Spain from every part of Ireland, it is highly probable we owe Don
Philip’s taste for Irish history. The prominent figure of his family in
the Irish war, the society of persons who had been engaged in its
most etii-ring soenes, and the exhortations of his preceptor, Father
Synnott, must all have inspired him to publish the feats of his country
and kindred for the Oatholic saith, and prove that the exiles were not
unworthy pensioners of the Catholic king. It is manifest& from his
