EDITOR’S PREFACE.

Snoum a student propose to himself to write 1110 Church History of
the Irish 0811101108 since the Reformation, he would find that the ma-
terials for the chief part of that (1081181110 work remain as they were
” nearly a century ago. The research which 1188 contributed, es-
pecially during the last ten years, so many original accessions, both
to profane and to mediaeval ecclesiastical history, has added but little
to the materiale for modern ecclesiastical history, which are contained 111
1110 Hibernia Dominicana. Many valuahlo manuscripts, and some
books almost as rare as manuscripts, which it appears the learned
author of that work never saw, still await, and will amply repay the
cares of an editor. It is true, the story of the Irish 0811101108 1188
110011 80 fertile a 11101110 for orators, pamphleteers, and historiam,
that 8 library might be stocked with works, written during the last
8010111)ν years, on that subject alone. 'l'hese compilations, how-
ever, principally regard Catholics in their relations to the civil power3
they record the edicts of the persecutor-s, but seldom introduce us to
the private history of the catacombs3 and closely though the religious
and political history of the Irish people has been blended, you will
osten search in vain in 811 these works for the first elements of eccle-
818811081 history; the lives and succession of the prelates in the diffe-
rent sees; a consecutive history of 1110 religious orders, the means hy
11111011 1110 clergy 11010 1001011011 81111 supported3 1110 places of public
worship5 the biography of eminent ecclesiastics3 the various plans de.
vised by fanaticism to eradicate the Catholic saith} and many other

topics which belong exclusively to ecclesiastical history.
