affect the substance of the facts· 'l'he truth ia, he did not overcome so
completely as he expected, the difficulty which deterred Father Synnott
ἶ from writing. The materiale from which he compiled were the oral
narratives of the exiles, or unconnected MSS. sketches, and in a war so
long, so eventful, conducted by the impulses of different independent
chieftainS, it would have been impossible for the most tenacious memory
to retain the exact dates or the succession of facts. Stin, fiom the very
great number of facts verified in the noteS, the impl-esaion, it is confidently
hoped, must be that those which rest on his authority alone, may be
received with as much credit as is ordinarily given to the word of ⁴ any
single author, compiling from the narratives of one party. in a revolu-
tionary war.

The sketches of the lives and martyrdom of some Irish prelates and
ecclesiastica, especially Hurley, Archbishop of Oashel‚ and Offlevany,
Bishop of Down and Oonnor, are given at great length, and appear to

reigns of Elizabeth and J ames. It lays down, plainly md repeatedly,
the only principles that must guide the historian in his study of that
momentous period. Without asserting that an who opposed Eh'zabeth
were influenced solely by religion, and much less that none of them
were so before the year 1600, he shews how the proscription of the
national creed did, from the very commencement of Eh'zabeth's reign,
provoke the mass of the people to disaffection, and how futile were the
attempta to pervert them.

Resides the ποι-116 already mentioned, the author, ‘it is believed, drew
up an account of the state of Ireland, which was presented to the King
of Spain by Florence Conry, Archbishop of Tuam. Whether he com-
pleted any of the other works which he meditated‚ especially one on
Astronomys* to which study he 'was partial, the Editor has not disco-
vered. The date or place of his death is not known, the last notice of
him being in the year 1634, when he sent the translation oi the Irish
