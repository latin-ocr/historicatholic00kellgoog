country, ving been, according to Dr. Eirington‚ grou θεας erated into
crime of enm-mous renim mad tyr-auuyl’· On the occasion o Falkland’s
taking the oaths o office, Usaher delivered the fanatica! harangue ou
the text, ‘⁶ He beareth not the ενοι-(1 in vain,” in which he insisted,
even according to his own extenuating re ort of the sermon, that in all
things short ‘⁶ of the effusion of blood, ” t e penal statutes should be en-
forced. This sermon, which was delivered on the eth of Se tember, 1622,
excited great alarin among the Catholics ς and on the 29th of t e same mouth,
it appears, the first letter referred to in the preceding document had been
written, describing “ the very oppressed and wretched state of the
countr .”

Thoiyigb Ussher’s intolerance had drawn down upon him a severe rebuke
from the Archbishop of Armagh‚ he ained his point ε “the swerd was not
to be borne in vain-’⁹ Two months azer his sermon, he was invited by the
Lord Deputy to remonstrate with some catholic magistrates, who had been
summoned before the Privy Oouncil for refusing to take the cath of supre-
macy (p. 68). It ie said his remonstrance was partially suecesssu13 and‘in
January, 1623, he received a letter from the kin , comphmenting him on his
zeal and good services to the stete. This interfference with catholic magis-
trates is referred to in the second paragraph of the preceding letter. So far

For, accordm to Dr. Elrington, nothing but “ gross exaggeration” could
represent the en orcement of the penal aetates, and the banishment of the

disadvantages ” ( . 72); they had been sus ended from the year 1613 (p . 21
